## FAQ:

* **Why don't you switch to windows?**
* I already spent an obscene amount of time with Apple products ever since I was little. MacBooks, iPods, iPhones, AirPods, and most importantly AppleScript. Couldn't live without them.

* **Why do you code in AppleScript?**
* First) I do not only code in AppleScript, I just don't feel the comfort I have with AppleScript in any other language. <br>
Second) It can do very powerful things while remaining beginner-friendly.

* **Why are you obsessed with Stack Exchange even though you have a measly [insert my current reputation on any given SE-network here] reputation?**
* I just think that some aspects of it could be improved and because Stack Exchange literally can't change them, I try to do what I can.
